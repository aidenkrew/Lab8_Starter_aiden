Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that service workers enable web applications to continue functioning even when network connectivity is lost or limited, which is a core principle of graceful degradation. Graceful degradation focuses on ensuring that essential functionality remains available in less-than-ideal conditions. Service workers help achieve this by caching resources and handling network requests, allowing the app to provide a usable experience even when offline or when the server is unreachable.
